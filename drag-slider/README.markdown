# WebGL enhanced javascript drag slider (performance improved - bonus)

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/martinlaxenaire/pen/EqxojQ](https://codepen.io/martinlaxenaire/pen/EqxojQ).

To help promote the release of curtains.js v3.0 and introduce the post-processing capabilities of the library, I've wrote a 3 parts tutorial on how to build a WebGL enhanced drag slider on medium.

This pen is a fork of the original end result of the third part of this tutorial: https://medium.com/@martin.laxenaire/webgl-enhanced-drag-slider-tutorial-with-curtains-js-part-3-4ea0791b4a54
